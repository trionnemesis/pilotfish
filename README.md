# pilotfish 🐟

> Pilot fish swim alongside the ocean's largest predators — small, fast, and doing the routine work so the big one doesn't have to.

**pilotfish** is a multi-model orchestration layer for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com): the frontier model (Claude Fable 5 / Opus) plans, decides, and reviews in your main session, while cheaper models (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku) execute the volume work through global subagents. Quality is protected by fresh-context verification, not by using the biggest model everywhere. Everything installs globally — one setup, every project — and the whole stack degrades gracefully when the frontier model becomes unavailable.

> **Want OpenAI GPT-5.6 inside Claude Code without changing native Claude state?** [Remora](https://github.com/Nanako0129/remora-cc) packages pilotfish's role-based orchestration pattern into a session-scoped launcher for an existing Anthropic-compatible gateway. Use pilotfish to study or customize the global policy; use Remora for an approval-gated, verifiable install whose model and gateway overrides disappear with the child process.

**Where this came from:** my weekly quota reset one morning, and the first thing I did with a fresh Fable 5 allowance was ask it to figure out why the previous week's had evaporated. The original setup that research produced was three config files with no runtime code. This fork keeps the installed Claude surface configuration-only while adding offline Python routing, compilation, evaluation, and lifecycle tooling. The research notes (with sources) are in [docs/](./docs/).

## Why

Frontier-model sessions are expensive in exactly the place it hurts subscribers: Claude Fable 5 consumes subscription limits **~2× faster than Opus** (official UI wording), and agentic sessions with heavy tool use burn far steeper than that in practice. Meanwhile, most tokens in a coding session are *not* judgment — they're searching, mechanical edits, test runs, and doc updates that a cheaper model does just as well.

Every piece of this now carries Anthropic backing. The [Fable 5 prompting guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-fable-5) recommends frequent subagent delegation and notes that **independent fresh-context verifier subagents outperform self-critique**. And as of 2026-07-08, the cheap-executor split is officially benchmarked: Anthropic's own tests put a **Fable 5 orchestrator with Sonnet 5 workers at 96% of all-Fable performance for 46% of the cost** (BrowseComp: 86.8% vs 90.8% accuracy, $18.53 vs $40.56 per problem), with the inverse advisor pattern (Sonnet executor consulting Fable) at ~92% for ~63% on SWE-bench Pro — the orchestrator split pilotfish uses won on both axes ([multi-agent docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/multi-agent)). A community experiment points the same direction at hobby scale — a delegation-heavy 12-worker audit ([Developers Digest](https://www.developersdigest.tech/blog/fable-5-orchestrator-model-playbook)), best-case-shaped, in API dollars:

| Setup (12-worker audit experiment, Developers Digest) | Cost | Savings |
|---|---|---|
| Everything on Fable 5 | $14.50 | — |
| Fable 5 orchestrates + Sonnet workers | $6.10 | 58% |
| Fable 5 orchestrates + Haiku workers | $3.70 | 74% |

Two subscription-specific bonuses stack on top:

> **Tip:** Claude subscriptions use a two-bucket weekly limit ([official article](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/14552983-models-usage-and-limits-in-claude-code)) — a shared "all models" bucket plus an **additional Sonnet-only bucket**. Routing execution to Sonnet subagents costs less per token *and* draws on that extra dedicated headroom. (Sonnet usage still counts against the all-models bucket too — it's additional allowance, not a fully separate pool.)

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Since Claude Code v2.1.198 the built-in `Explore` subagent inherits your main-session model. If your main session runs Fable 5 or Opus, every background search burns Opus-tier tokens (the Claude API caps Explore's inherited model at Opus; third-party platforms have no cap). pilotfish overrides it back to Haiku. (Trade-off, stated openly: a custom Explore loads your user memory like any subagent, which the built-in skips — the policy block self-disables for subagent roles to keep that overhead small.)

> **Note:** The two bullets above are subscription-plan mechanics. On the pay-per-token API the per-token savings still apply (there is no weekly bucket). On Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry, aliases resolve to each platform's built-in defaults and Fable 5 may not be enabled — pin versions with the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` env vars before relying on `best` there.

## How it works

Three layers, three files' worth of configuration, all under `~/.claude/`:

| Layer | File(s) | Job |
|---|---|---|
| Machine | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Who orchestrates (`best`) + automatic `fallbackModel` chain |
| Roles | `~/.claude/agents/*.md` | Seven leaf role agents, each pinned to the canonical model tier via one line of frontmatter |
| Policy | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | *How* to delegate — written in terms of roles, never model names |

    M --> V["verifier<br>opus · fresh context"]
    E --> V
    SE --> V
    SEC --> V
    V -->|CONFIRMED / REFUTED| O
```

The seven roles:

| Role | Model | Effort | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scout` | haiku | low | Read-only lookups: "where/how is X", symbol usages, config values |
| `Explore` | haiku | low | Overrides the built-in Explore agent (see warning above) |
| `mech-executor` | sonnet | low | Fully-specified mechanical work: pattern refactors, convention tests, docs, bulk edits |
| `executor` | sonnet | high | Bounded implementation needing judgment: features, bug fixes, design-sensitive refactors |
| `senior-executor` | opus | high | High-risk or canonically escalated implementation |
| `verifier` | opus | medium | Fresh-context adversarial verification; returns CONFIRMED/REFUTED, never fixes |
| `security-executor` | opus | high | Anything security-sensitive — deliberately kept off Fable 5, whose safety classifiers can refuse benign defensive-security work |

The policy layer requires a schema-valid Task Envelope and the canonical deterministic router before dispatch. It treats `REFINE`, `TAKEOVER`, and `BLOCK` as control-plane outcomes rather than invented roles, keeps security work on its fixed lane, lets every named role take its model only from its agent definition, and gates non-trivial work behind fresh-context verification.

## Install

The seven-role installer is currently published on the fork's Phase 2 review branch, not the legacy upstream `v1.1.5` tag. Clone that explicit ref locally, detach at the resolved commit, inspect it, and then start Claude Code so it can read the runbook as a local file:

```sh
git clone --branch codex/phase-2-claude-adapter --single-branch https://github.com/trionnemesis/pilotfish.git
cd pilotfish
git switch --detach HEAD
git rev-parse HEAD
claude
```

In that Claude Code session, paste this prompt:

```text
Read the local file install/AGENT-INSTALL.md in the current checkout and follow it to install pilotfish into my global Claude Code configuration.
Show me the full plan of changes and get my approval before writing anything.
```

Claude reads the local install runbook, inspects your existing configuration, shows you a merge plan (nothing is overwritten blindly), and applies it after you approve. Installation is idempotent — running it again upgrades in place.

> **Note:** Installation requires Claude Code 2.1.207 or newer so the seven roles' tool allowlists and denylists are enforced. The local installer blocks before writing when it cannot verify that runtime floor. Restart your session afterwards: the agents directory is scanned at session start, and the `model` setting applies on restart.

Remote agent-facing install prompts are intentionally unsupported. Use a pinned local checkout; never disable or bypass WebFetch, sandbox, approval, or prompt-injection protections to install pilotfish.

Prefer to do it by hand? The same steps are written for humans in [install/AGENT-INSTALL.md](./install/AGENT-INSTALL.md), and every file it installs lives under [templates/](./templates/).

## Trust & security

pilotfish compiles canonical local artifacts and merges them into your global `~/.claude/` config — including a policy block that then loads into **every future session**. Treat the checkout as executable configuration: inspect and pin it before running the installer.

- **Read the actual bytes that get installed**, not just the runbook: the seven files in [templates/agents/](./templates/agents/), [templates/claude-md.orchestration.md](./templates/claude-md.orchestration.md), and the settings patch. The installer also writes private ownership state, backups, and rollback manifests under `~/.claude/pilotfish/`.
- **Pin to a release tag or commit** so what you reviewed is what installs — branches can change between the moment you read them and the moment Claude reads them. The preview command above resolves the fork's Phase 2 branch and immediately detaches the checkout; record and review the printed full commit SHA before launching Claude. Once a release containing this installer exists, prefer that immutable tag or its full SHA.
- **Keep the approval gate:** writes require the exact SHA-256 fingerprint of the reviewed plan. Do not weaken or bypass WebFetch, sandbox, approval, or prompt-injection protections.
- **Respect the platform boundary:** POSIX mutations use descriptor-relative no-follow confinement. On Windows, the installer accepts only a target inside the current operator's resolved profile and does not support elevated or cross-user installs; that boundary lets it rely on the current profile ACL rather than claiming POSIX-equivalent directory descriptors.

## What gets installed

| Target | Change | Reversible |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Merge missing compiler-owned settings keys; preserve unrelated or conflicting user values | Yes — key-level compare-and-swap |
| `~/.claude/agents/` | Seven compiler-emitted role agent files (listed above) | Yes — only unchanged owned files are removed |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | One `## Orchestration` section between `<!-- pilotfish:begin/end -->` markers | Yes — remove the marker block |
| `~/.claude/pilotfish/` | Private hash-only ownership state, backups, and rollback manifests | Yes — manifests drive bounded rollback |

Nothing is written into any project. That's deliberate — see the design doc.

## Updating

The installer is idempotent, so **re-running it from a newer pinned checkout is the update**. Unchanged files are skipped; user-modified owned content is preserved and reported. First obtain the release tag or commit you want to upgrade to, then clone and inspect that checkout locally:

```sh
git clone --branch <REVIEWED_FORK_REF> --single-branch https://github.com/trionnemesis/pilotfish.git
cd pilotfish
git switch --detach HEAD
git rev-parse HEAD
claude
```

If you require a full commit SHA instead, fetch and check out that SHA before starting Claude Code.

Then follow the local runbook's dry-run and fingerprint-bound update commands:

```text
Read the local file install/AGENT-INSTALL.md in the current checkout and follow its Update section. Show the exact dry-run plan and do not write until I approve that plan's fingerprint.
```

| Want to… | How |
|---|---|
| Check what you have installed | `grep -o "pilotfish v[0-9.]*" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — no output with markers present = pre-v1.1.0, update recommended |
| Get notified of new releases | GitHub → **Watch → Custom → Releases** on this repo |
| See what changed | [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) — every release is also a git tag |
| Stay frozen on a reviewed version | Install pinned to a tag or SHA (see [Trust & security](#trust--security)); pinned installs never move until you re-pin |

## The fallback story

The whole stack keeps working when the frontier model disappears, because no policy text ever names a model:

| Failure mode | What catches it | Your action |
|---|---|---|
| Fable 5 leaves your plan (e.g. the July 2026 subscription changes) | `best` re-resolves to the latest Opus — the documented rule, and how the June 2026 outage actually behaved (notice banner, new sessions continued on Opus) | Likely none — the exact boundary UX is unpublished; worst case is one `/model` switch or enabling usage credits. Never pin `fable`/full IDs: pinned IDs hard-errored in June |
| Model overloaded / API errors | `fallbackModel: ["opus", "sonnet"]` switches automatically with a notice | None |
| A tier gets deprecated (Opus 4.8 → 4.9, Sonnet 5 → next) | Role agents use aliases (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) that track the recommended version | None |
| Frontier refuses a security task mid-run | Security work is pre-routed to `security-executor` (Opus), so it never reaches the classifier | None |

The delegation policy in `CLAUDE.md` speaks only of roles (`executor`, `scout`, …). Model bindings live in exactly one place — one line of frontmatter per agent file — so re-pointing a tier is a one-line edit that takes effect everywhere.

## Tuning & FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| I want to save even more quota | Switch the main session to `/model opusplan` — Opus thinks in plan mode, Sonnet executes. The role agents keep working unchanged underneath. |
| Can I force every subagent onto one model? | `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` overrides *all* per-agent frontmatter — that's why pilotfish doesn't set it. Leave it unset unless you want a temporary global override. |
| I use `availableModels` as an allowlist | Then it must contain every alias the agents use (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`), or those agents silently fall back to inheriting the main-session model. The installer checks this. |
| Why `effort: low` on the cheap roles? | Effort is the second big quota lever. Fable-5-generation models at low effort routinely match previous-generation `xhigh`; recon and mechanical work don't need deep thinking. |
| Which effort for the main session? | `high`. Official guidance for Fable 5: `high` for most work, `xhigh` only for the longest-horizon tasks, `max` rarely — diminishing returns. |
| Do I lose the 1M context window? | No — Fable 5 is 1M by default, so `best` gives you 1M whenever it resolves to Fable 5. If you want *guaranteed* 1M even when `best` would fall back to Opus, set `model` to `"opus[1m]"` instead (the `[1m]` suffix is documented for `sonnet`/`opus`/`opusplan`/full IDs, not for `best`). |
| Does the orchestrator ever do work itself? | Yes — quick single-file reads, decisions, and anything you explicitly asked *it* to judge. Delegation has overhead; the policy says so. |
| My project has its own CLAUDE.md — conflict? | No file is ever touched: pilotfish writes only under `~/.claude/`. At runtime Claude Code *stacks* project memory and user memory — both load together, neither overrides the other. If one repo needs different behavior, add a local note there (e.g. "work inline in this repo, don't delegate") — the more specific instruction wins in practice. |
| Subagent quality worries me | That's what `verifier` is for: an independent fresh-context pass that tries to *refute* the work. Official guidance: fresh-context verifiers beat self-critique. Escalation (two strikes → higher tier) handles the rest. Note verification isn't free either — it re-reads context on Opus — which is why the policy scopes it to non-trivial work only. |
| Doesn't spawning agents cost extra? | Yes — every spawn is a fresh context that re-reads its slice of the codebase, and spec-writing costs main-session tokens. That overhead is why the policy says don't delegate single-file reads or quick judgments. The savings come from volume work (search, bulk edits, test runs), where the cheaper tier's per-token price dwarfs the spawn overhead. |
| Turn it off fast? | **This session:** tell Claude "don't delegate this session — work inline"; it's just policy text, it obeys immediately. **This repo:** add a local note to the repo's CLAUDE.md. **Whole machine:** comment out the `pilotfish:begin/end` block in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — the agent files just sit unused. No reinstall needed to switch back. |
| Managed / enterprise machine? | Managed settings outrank user settings: a managed `model`, `availableModels` allowlist, or a managed agent with the same name will override pilotfish's user-level install. If roles don't take effect after restart, ask your admin — pilotfish can't (and shouldn't) override managed policy. |

## Research & design

This repo is the packaged result of a sourced research pass (official docs, Anthropic announcements, community measurements) plus a design rationale:

| Document | Language | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| [docs/research.md](./docs/research.md) | English | Full research findings: Fable 5 strengths & when it's wasteful, subscription economics, official Claude Code mechanisms, community measurements — with sources |
| [docs/research.zh-TW.md](./docs/research.zh-TW.md) | 繁體中文 | 研究報告原版（the original the English version translates） |
| [docs/design.md](./docs/design.md) | English | Why three layers, why role-based policy, why aliases over pinned IDs, effort tiering, what was deliberately left out |

**Prior art & credits.** The "smart brain, cheap hands" split is not pilotfish's invention: Anthropic's own engineering writeup ([Decoupling the brain from the hands](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/managed-agents)) frames it, Claude Code ships [`opusplan`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config) built in — if all you want is cheaper sessions, `/model opusplan` needs no repo at all — and [Rylaa/fable5-orchestrator](https://github.com/Rylaa/fable5-orchestrator) packages the same frugality thesis as a plugin with ledger-enforcing guard hooks. pilotfish's contribution is the packaging: seven deliberately-few leaf roles instead of a 100-agent catalog, a canonical router plus role-based policy that survives model churn, and a fingerprint-approved installer with bounded rollback. If a heavier, hook-enforced flavor fits you better, use theirs.

## Uninstall

From the pinned local checkout, ask Claude Code to run the local uninstall plan:

```text
Read the local file install/AGENT-INSTALL.md and follow its Uninstall section.
Show the exact dry-run plan and do not write until I approve that plan's fingerprint.
```
