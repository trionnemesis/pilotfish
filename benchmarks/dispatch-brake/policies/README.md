The baseline and balanced task-local policies are pinned to canonical repository commits rather than mutable current files. The development candidates are stored here because they were never canonical product policies. Later positive-control iterations, including the rejected direct-speed veto, broad net-benefit rule, subjective size wording, and unshipped skill-precedence probe, are documented with their observable behavior in [`../positive-controls/`](../positive-controls/). The phase-aware release candidate was written after reinterpreting the Baton probes as incomplete discovery-only observations; its separate two-turn lifecycle, exact prompts, content hashes, rejected harness run, and limits are published in the compatibility Gate. Raw stream hashes preserve each experiment's identity, and no rejected wording is presented as a shipped product policy.
