# Changelog

All notable changes to pilotfish. The installed version is stamped inside the policy block in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (`<!-- pilotfish vX.Y.Z -->`); installs older than v1.1.0 carry no stamp.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-07-14

Add phase-aware orchestration informed by [Baton](https://github.com/cablate/baton). Small stable work remains direct. Large, ambiguous, architectural, risky, or cross-surface work can use bounded read-only discovery before its implementation outcome is known; the main session then synthesizes one Plan, may request a fresh readiness review, and waits for explicit approval before writing when the task requires a Plan gate. Execution keeps the strict brake: stable scope, exclusive ownership, constraints, done criteria, integration, and verification.

Single unknown bugs still keep root-cause discovery, trace-driven debugging, the first minimal fix, and live verification in one orchestrator reasoning chain instead of becoming a sequential scout-to-executor pipeline. Large cross-surface investigations may use bounded read-only discovery, but must return to main-session Plan synthesis before any executor starts. Task-local scans stay inline by default; substantial independent surfaces, overlapable latency, or evidence needed to reduce Plan uncertainty retain explicit discovery paths. Stable multi-file repetition retains an explicit path to `mech-executor`.

Fresh verification is split by capability instead of relying on mode text. The new `plan-verifier` has a positive read-only tool allowlist and returns `READY` / `REVISE` before approval; the existing `verifier` remains read-and-run after implementation and returns `CONFIRMED` / `REFUTED`. Security follows the same boundary: the new read-only `security-reviewer` gathers pre-approval evidence, while the write-capable `security-executor` accepts only an approved stable implementation contract. Plan synthesis and final judgment stay in the main session, and named-role model ownership remains unchanged.

Fix the long-running-process handoff based on four direct harness trials reported by [@dromsak](https://github.com/dromsak) in PR #10. Every Bash-capable leaf role (`mech-executor`, `executor`, `verifier`, `security-executor`) now rejects `nohup`, `setsid`, trailing `&`, and subagent-side background commands: detaching escapes task tracking and orphans the result. A subagent that cannot finish a foreground command within 10 minutes reports the exact command, absolute worktree or working directory, required environment, and input paths; the main orchestrator owns tracked background execution in that same context rather than the parent checkout. Agents likely to run a long command must themselves be spawned in the background, because a timeout-promoted command in a foreground-spawned agent is terminated shortly after that agent returns.

This release publishes the complete bilingual experiment behind the dispatch decision: negative and positive-control fixtures, neutral prompts, rejected policy iterations, exact Agent tool inputs, normalized traces, model usage, timing, client-reported cost fields, raw-stream hashes, commands, correctness results, and limitations. A hard direct-speed veto suppressed useful delegation; the balanced policy still routed a stable 12-file mechanical edit to the cheaper worker. In the execution-only segment, before the release policy's required outcome-verifier pass, the delegated run reported 36.01% less cost with a 7.92% wall-time trade-off. This proves the cheaper route remains reachable, not full-lifecycle savings.

The dispatch report now scopes the earlier small-research result correctly. Two scouts were slower and more expensive than direct work on that single task-local fixture, while the early Baton-assisted probes stopped immediately after discovery dispatch and therefore established neither conflict nor end-to-end compatibility. The separate [pilotfish + Baton compatibility gate](./benchmarks/baton-compatibility/README.md) now closes that lifecycle gap under native Claude routing.

Policy contract tests lock the phase boundary, approval gate, planning-skill composition, capability-separated Plan and outcome verification, read-only pre-approval security review, verdict vocabulary, named-role model ownership, background scheduling, worktree isolation, long-process ownership, and fresh-context verification. The final fresh-session two-turn Gate completed zero-write Discovery and main-session Plan synthesis, an Opus `plan-verifier` returning `READY`, explicit approval, a Sonnet `mech-executor` selected by Baton, and a separate Opus outcome `verifier` returning `CONFIRMED`. All three named-role calls omitted invocation-level `model`; `npm test` passed and `REPORT.md` was the only change. The exact tested project policy and eight-role agents JSON are committed under `benchmarks/baton-compatibility/final-gate-snapshot/`, with their recorded hashes locked against current templates except for the inert version-stamp comment: the tested candidate said v1.1.6 and was reclassified as v1.2.0 before release because this is a feature-level orchestration change. The run took 448.148 seconds and reported $3.7890481 in the client cost field; these are single-run observations, not population estimates or an invoice. Rejected or superseded harness runs remain disclosed rather than presented as release evidence.

## v1.1.5 — 2026-07-13

Fix named-role model routing at the Agent invocation boundary. The orchestration policy now requires calls to every existing named role to omit `model`, leaving the role file's frontmatter as the sole model source. This prevents an invocation alias from silently overriding the intended Haiku, Sonnet, or Opus assignment. Only truly ad-hoc agents with no named role definition may set an explicit invocation model.

This release also recommends a pinned local checkout for one-prompt installation and updates. The reviewed runbook and templates are read from the same release checkout, avoiding mutable cross-fetches and preserving Claude Code's WebFetch prompt-injection protection instead of asking users to bypass it.

New dependency-free policy tests lock the version stamp, named-role model ownership contract, ad-hoc exception, role frontmatter, and pinned README install commands together.

## v1.1.4 — 2026-07-13

Fix foreground-only delegation caused by an underspecified parallel-agent policy. The orchestrator now schedules by immediate data dependency: independent work and every independent fan-out call use `run_in_background: true`, while foreground execution is reserved for a result required by the very next main-session action when no other useful work can proceed. Background results still must be collected before dependent work or the final answer.

## v1.1.3 — 2026-07-12

Community-driven patch. Re-run the install prompt to upgrade.

| Change | Credit |
|---|---|
| **The orchestration policy now covers running agents in parallel** — three rules earned in a real four-executor fan-out (long-form rationale in [#7](https://github.com/Nanako0129/pilotfish/pull/7)): every writing agent in a parallel batch gets its own worktree, and the orchestrator harvests each worktree's changes on completion; a yielded agent (detached launch, PID + log path) is a handoff the orchestrator must monitor and resume, not a result; agent liveness is probed with a message, never diagnosed from host signals (no local CPU + a stale transcript is not a stuck agent). | [@dromsak](https://github.com/dromsak) (#7) |

The liveness rule's probe semantics were verified empirically before merging (a busy agent queues the probe; a completed one is resumed by it), which caught that the exact response strings vary across harness versions — the shipped rule describes the behavior instead of quoting strings.

## v1.1.2 — 2026-07-10

Hardening patch. Re-run the install prompt to upgrade.

| Change | Credit |
|---|---|
| **The six roles are now hard leaf agents.** The four executor roles get `disallowedTools: Agent, Workflow`; `verifier` extends its existing read-only exclusions with the same; `scout`/`Explore` were already leaves via their `tools` allowlist. Each also carries an explicit "you are a leaf agent" line so a genuinely mis-routed task is reported back instead of re-delegated. | [@dromsak](https://github.com/dromsak) (#6) |

This replaces v1.1.1's prompt-only guard with capability removal. The prompt guard put the routing table into every subagent's context, so a `mech-executor` could pattern-match its own task and re-delegate — observed cascading four levels deep in a real incident. Verified before merge: with the prompt guard a nested role still spawned (a haiku scout ran real work); with `disallowedTools` the spawn is blocked and the role does the work itself.

## v1.1.1 — 2026-07-10

Community-driven patch. Re-run the install prompt to upgrade.

| Change | Credit |
|---|---|
| Policy block now forbids subagent roles from spawning further subagents — delegation is a main-session-only concern. The recursive-spawn risk was verified empirically (a sonnet role successfully dispatched a haiku role) before merging | [@nicofirst1](https://github.com/nicofirst1) (#3, #5) |
| `executor` / `mech-executor` no longer babysit long-running processes: launch detached (nohup + log), one sanity check, then yield with PID + log path for the orchestrator to monitor | [@nicofirst1](https://github.com/nicofirst1) (#2, #4) |
| Follow-up to the above: a detached launch must be reported as a handoff, not a completed verification, when done-criteria depend on the process outcome | maintainer |
| Installer Step 4 verification updated for Claude Code 2.1.198+ (the `/agents` wizard was removed); verify via `/model` and by asking Claude which subagent types are available | [@zxcj04](https://github.com/zxcj04) (#1) |

## v1.1.0 — 2026-07-09

Security, accuracy, and update-flow release. Re-running the install prompt upgrades in place.

### Security & trust

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| New **Trust & security** README section, with a tag/SHA-pinned install variant | `main` can change between review and install (TOCTOU); pinning makes what-you-reviewed = what-installs |
| Runbook: templates must be fetched from the same pinned ref as the runbook | Pinning now covers the actual installed bytes, not just the instructions |
| `scout` / `Explore` switched from a `disallowedTools` denylist to a positive `tools: Read, Glob, Grep` allowlist | They previously retained Bash, so "read-only" was prompted, not enforced |
| Runbook detects agent collisions by frontmatter `name:` (not filename) and flags plugin shadowing | Claude Code loads only one definition per name; `executor`/`scout` are common names |

### Behavior & quality

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| Policy block self-disables for subagent roles | A custom `Explore` loads user memory (the built-in skips it); the policy is main-session-only |
| New policy rule: scout findings are unverified inputs | The verifier gate covers executor output, not reconnaissance |
| `verifier` runs maximum-thoroughness on security-sensitive work | medium-effort verification of high-effort security work was inconsistent |
| Versioning + "Updating an existing install" flow (this release) | Early installs had no way to learn about updates |

### Docs & claim accuracy

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| Split Anthropic's endorsement (delegation + fresh-context verification) from pilotfish's own cheap-model routing thesis | Attribution honesty |
| 12-worker numbers reframed as an upper-bound, API-dollar experiment, with inline sources | One community experiment ≠ a guarantee; subscription quota ≠ API dollars |
| Explore warning corrected: inherited model is Opus-capped on the Claude API | Precision |
| `best`-alias fallback at the 7/12 boundary restated honestly (documented rule + June outage precedent; boundary UX unpublished; `fallbackModel` never triggers on billing errors) | The boundary hasn't been observed by anyone yet |
| Windows portability note; subscription-vs-API/Bedrock scope note; FAQ rows for spawn overhead, fast off-switch, managed environments, project-CLAUDE.md stacking | Compatibility coverage |

## v1.0.0 — 2026-07-08

Initial public release: three-layer global architecture (settings `best` + `fallbackModel`, six role agents with tiered model/effort bindings, role-based delegation policy), one-prompt agent-guided installer with approval gate and idempotent upgrades, bilingual README, sourced research report and design rationale.
